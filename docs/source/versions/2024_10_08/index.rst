Welcome to Introduction to Bioimage Analysis using ImageJ/Fiji! 
===================================================================

This set of slides introduces participants to key concepts in bioimage analysis using the open-source software **ImageJ/Fiji**. It is designed as a primer for biologists who need to analyze images as part of their research but are new to image analysis.
This course also stresses out the importance of reproducibility and quantiative image analysis in biological research.

The following materials were developed for a workshop taught in-person at Harvard Medical School, organized by the `Image Analysis Collaboratory <https://iac.hms.harvard.edu/>`_.
